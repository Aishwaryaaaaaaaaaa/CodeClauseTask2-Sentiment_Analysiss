# CodeClauseTask2-Sentiment_Analysiss
  In this project , i have used several libraries such as NumPy , Pandas , Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the data.

The project involve several processes such as Data Pre-processing ,Distribution Of classes , Exploratory Data Analysis , Visualisation through heatmaps  , stemming , splitting the data into training and testing data.

After preprocessing the data , I used Logistic Regression Algorithm to build a predictive model.The model was trained using the training data and then i evaluated its performance on the test data.

Overall , this project aimed to analyse the positive , negative or neutral review out of a dataset and build a predictive model for detecting positive or negative review.
